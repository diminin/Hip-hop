Remaining movement points after attacking are added to the attack of the first round.

A castle has base 3 defense every round and 20 hp, a horse has 2 base movement points every turn and 10 hp and a bishop has base 2 attack every round and 15 hp.

A player starts with 2 of each unit and the game can be played with 2-4 players.

There is no limit to how many cards you can have in your deck.
